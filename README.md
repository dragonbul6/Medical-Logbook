I have been working on senior project in backend role. Have various task to do. In my opinion, a lot pf my skill such as Coding , Algorithm , and Collaborative with other frontend.

In my senior project , called "Medical Logbook".
It's the web application and mobile application for some role of user.
It provides ease to medical student. During 3-6 years of studying.
They have plenty of stuff to do. One of them is to diagnosis patient and note the detail in their old form, so my part is to create something to reduce paper works in this progress.
I am current working in backend. Using cloud database, Which is mongoDB and Node.Js as my server. At Development phase , our group use heroku as a host service for ease to develop.
